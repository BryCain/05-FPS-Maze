# Project 05 - FPS Maze
Project 05 - FPS Maze for MSCH-C220 at IU Bloomington. Created November 17, 2022.

This is my attempt at a 2D FPS Maze. Because I had several other assignments due around the same time as this one, this project is a little more barebones than usual. I mainly just stuck to the basic solution, with a couple of extra features.

## Implementation
Includes a first-person player-controlled character that can move with keyboard and mouse control, a procedurally generated maze using Constructive Solid Geometry, materials for the wall and floor, a key to pick up, an enemy, an in-game menu, an end-game screen, sound effects, and music.
